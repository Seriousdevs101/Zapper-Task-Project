​This repository contains an AR example using the Zappar SDK for THREE.js. This specific project uses webpack to compile and bundle the assets and codes

# Running the Project

​Once you have cloned this repository, open a terminal in the root directory of this project and follow these steps to get started.​Install the dependencies by running:​

     npm install
  
 ​Next, run the project using the following command:​
 
     npm start

The webpack server tool will host the content locally and give you an address you can open in your browser of your local machine.​We recommend launching instant world tracking and image tracked projects on a mobile device to get the best user experience. If you'd like to try on a mobile device, follow these steps:​

Ensure the device is on the same local network (e.g. Wifi)
Find out the IP address of your computer
On your mobile device,
    visit: https://YOUR-IP-ADDRESS:PORT   
 replacing both YOUR-IP-ADDRESS and PORT (the port is the number after the : in the address given by webpack-dev-server). Note it's important to type https at the start of the address to ensure your device connects over HTTPS.
